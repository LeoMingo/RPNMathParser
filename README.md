# RPNMathParser

RPNMathParser is a designated math parser following the generic Reverse Polish Notation(RPN), which takes a string may or may not be containing arbitrary variables then returns a constant result or a calculated function with respect to the variables given.

It uses maps to pair up string names and the respective functions to make function maps, and is expected/hoped to cover a relatively broad domain of calculations, including calculus, linear algebra, statistics and many more.

RPNMathParser is more like an idea to data-fy functions, thus makes it easier to store or generate functions. It is supposed to be a subset of a much bigger following project, but it should be independent by its own features.
